** data is modified to remove the bug in dates within database (the year 1999 was written as 9999 in the dataset which has been corrected)

Eventhough the mentorship program will help with replacing some of the retiring employees, but it cannot resolve the issue as it is. Either the qualifications are eased to allow for more qualifications or the company will have to hire a large number of new employees.

## Summary
Due to the "silver tsunami" Pewlett Hackard will have to replace 76,177 retiring employees. There are sufficient retirement ready employees in all departments to mentor the next generation except for the manager title, which has two retirement-ready employees only.
